      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
technology
behind the scenes. WaveFrag is a new development in recognition
technology, and it is intended to cut a new path in this sector of
research. WaveFrag represents a new state in voice recognition, with
simplicity, and usability. It works on a completely new method, and its
accuracy rivals competitors that have been developing these kinds of
programs for a decade or more. Bear in mind WaveFrag engine is a new
development, and as such it carries a huge potential.<br>

WaveFrag is very efficient when it comes to computing power. It
requires a small fraction of the traditional voice recognition's
computing power. We
installed it on an old Dell computer and it worked flawlessly.&nbsp;
The processor on that computer was far less than one gigahertz. This
points us to the observation that WaveFrag voice recognition will work
on embedded platforms. <br>
            <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
WaveFrag is so simple, that it can be trained with one or two
pronunciation of the word.&nbsp; Yet it is powerful enough to recognize
the difference between the word 'tree' and 'three'. WaveFrag is speaker
independent, however, speech patterns that are extremely deviating from
the common, need to be trained.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technology itself represents a
breakthrough. Below is a short description of how we achieved such high
accuracy, consuming low computing power.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The
incoming voice is digitized by the computer's sound card, and is
presented to the voice recognition engine. The engine will execute all
of the functions needed to turn this into text. The text is then
presented to the application, which interprets it according to the
user's wish. The voice-recognition functions are partitioned into
several sub functions. First the voice is treated with an effective
normalization process. The sound levels are normalized to median level
for the engine to process.&nbsp; This is why WaveFrag is relatively
insensitive to the amplitude of the sound. <br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second stage, this
normalized sound is converted into a spectral image. The spectral image
is then normalized again , and&nbsp; then examined for dominant
spectra. This dominant spectra is captured, and fed to a comparison
engine. The comparison engine examines this spectral image and executes
a 'wobble' search function.&nbsp; The wobble search finds the closest
match in the WaveFrag dictionary,&nbsp; and delivers a match to the
currently examined spectral image. Naturally, one can adjust the level
stricktness for the required match, which allows the speech recognition
engine to be very associative, or very strict. This allows WaveFrag to
be deployed in diverse situations.&nbsp; With the recognition criteria
adjustable, WaveFrag can serve a multitude of functions from
entertainment grade went easy recognition is an advantage, to
industrial grade accurate recognition is essential. (little or no false
positives)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; In tests, we installed a WebCam on top of the computer monitor
screen, 6 feet away. The recognition engine have recognized all of the
words we pronounced. A test, which no other voice recognition engine
passes.<br>

Speaker
independence, and microphone independence. WaveFrag
achieves its Speaker independence by capturing the most common speech
patterns (or pronunciation patterns for that fact) and makes its
comparison accordingly. WaveFrag achieves its microphone independence
by virtue of the spectral analysis and the dominant spectrum filtering.
The dominant spectrum of the speech will stay consistent, with little
regard to the microphone's frequency characteristics or the sound
processing subsystem's artifact introduction. (aka. distortion and
clipping)<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I magine a healthcare workstation, were the medical
professional
enters the patient's room, and the professional pronounces the
words <span style="font-style: italic;">'Display Medication'</span> or
            <span style="font-style: italic;">'Show Status'</span> and
the workstation responds with
wit the appropriate screens, presenting the desired information. With
WaveFrag now this is a practical possibility.</td>

&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the higher level point of view, the WavFrag system
works by decomposing elements of the speech.&nbsp; The
decomposition provides&nbsp; basis for the recognition, and recognition
is achieved by a routine called&nbsp; 'doughnut' , which - following
the traditional wisdom - suggests to 'Look at the doughnut , not the
doughnut hole'&nbsp; ...&nbsp; a way to analyze dominant presence of
the parts of the speech.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
&nbsp; One of the outstanding features of the algorithm is
'push-ability'. When the user pronounces a word more distinctly, the
algorithm responds with better recognition, as opposed to the
traditional algorithms, which degrade when someone is enunciating
harder (or 'pushing it').&nbsp; <br>
