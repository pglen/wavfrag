Training</font><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wavefrag is
easy to train. Many times a single uttering (pronunciation of a word or
phrase) will train WaveFrag. Of course, pronouncing it several times
helps. In practical use we found that WaveFrag can compensate for most
accents, tired or sleepy voice, room acoustics, microphone differences,
sound card differences. There are some limitations to how much WaveFrag
can compensate, but if you find that WaveFrag doesn't recognize a
particular word, training is as easy as clicking on a button. <br>
      </div>
      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0"
 cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: middle;"><img

            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To train a new word, click on the 'New Word' button. A small dialog
shows up expecting an input string. Enter the name of this word. The
name doesn't have to match the pronounced word, but it helps in
identifying it later. After clicking okay, the word is added to the
'Trained Strings' list. With WaveFrag listening, pronounce the word.
The wave the window (on top) will show the wave form of the pronounced
word. Click on the 'Train this wav' button, and your newly trained word
is remembered. Pronouncing it again, and clicking on the 'Train' button
will train the word more, reinforcing your speech pattern. training at
two or three times will train the word into perfection.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; To monitor if you are satisfied with the current uttering, you
can always play back the current wave. A word of caution, the sound
coming from your loudspeaker will be recorded again if you are on a hot
microphone. In that case, instruct WaveFrag to stop listening, so you
can freely monitor or review the current uttering.<br>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To train an
existing word, select the desired word in the 'Trained Strings:' list
box, pronounce the word, and click on the 'Train this wav as' button.
(On the screen shot above, we clicked on 'Activate Next',&nbsp; and the
training button shows "Train this wav as 'Activate Next' ".&nbsp; To
review an existing word, select the desired word in the 'Trained
Strings:' list box, and click on the desired wav in the 'Waves for this
string' drop down box. the waveform should show in the top wave editing
window, one can play, edit, or crop the selected waveform. (Don't
forget to save it) To delete an existing wave,&nbsp; click on the
'Trained String' you desire, and in the 'Waves for this string' list
box, click on the wave you wish to delete. Once a wave is selected,
click on 'Delete Entry' button. A confirmation dialog will ask yes or
no. Answering yes will delete the wave. To delete an existing (trained)
word completely, select the desired string in the 'Trained Strings'
listbox, then click on the 'Delete Word'&nbsp; button. A confirmation
dialog will ask yes or no.&nbsp; Answering yes will delete the string,
and all of the wave files (and training) associated with it. Deleting
the word cannot be undone, however it is easy to retrain it.<br>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a word
is trained to your liking, you can add it as an action. An action can
execute a program, show an image, switch between windows, send
keystrokes to windows, or even shut down your system. In short,
WaveFrag can be configured to do almost anything with a computer.<br>
      </div>

      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0"

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clicking on the 'Add' button will open a small dialog to ask for the
name of the action. WaveFrag will pre fill the action name with the
name of the last uttering, but one can name the action to any name
desirable.&nbsp; Next, clicking on the configure button will call up
the action configuration dialog. this dialogue is described in more
detail in the <a href="comm.html">commands</a> section of this manual.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can edit any pre-existing action. Selecting an
action on the drop down box, and clicking on the 'Configure' button
will allow one to change that action. There are pre-made actions to
close windows, to switch between windows, to show images. None of those
actions are hardcoded, one can change any and all of them to a custom
command driven by a custom uttering. In fact, WaveFrag can be trained
in a foreign language as WaveFrag has no knowledge about lexical or
phonectic properties. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp; WaveFrag is very versatile when it comes to commanding your
computer by voice. One can train any word, any uttering, in fact any
noise to be recognized by WaveFrag, and acted upon.<br>
