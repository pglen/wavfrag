    This is THE core project for voice recognition research. All kinds of
ideas are implemented, tried out. Several kind of frequency analysis,
(FFT, Impulse, Square wave, flip flop), and several kind of voice analysis
 as well.
 
   Many of the attempts result in limited success, however this project 
is a valuable resource for further research. (info on what has been tried)
