    This is the core project for voice recognition research. 
        
All kinds of ideas are implemented, tried out. Several kind of frequency 
analysis, (FFT, Impulse, Square wave, flip flop), and several kind of 
voice analysis as well.
 
   Many of the attempts resulted in limited success, however this project 
is a valuable resource for further research. (info on what has been tried)

  At the end, there is a successful thread, can be used for reference or 
further resource ..
